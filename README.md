# NQueens
Solution to the N-Queens Problem using A*, Genetic, and Backtracking Search in Python


GUI is simpleGUI.
its a bit scuffed and it always opens in the bottom left of the screen.



The searchs are encapsulated into their own classes

I will be updating the code to make it more readable but in the meantime it works perfectly fine for most conditions
